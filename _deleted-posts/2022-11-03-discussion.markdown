## People, People, People<br><span style="font-size: 80%">Strong Architecture = Strong Architects</span>
> *”Architecture is not so much about the software, but about the people who write the software. The core principles of architecture, such as coupling and cohesion, aren't about the code. The code doesn't 'care' about how cohesive or decoupled it is; ... But people do care about their coupling to other team members.”* - James O. Coplien

> *"Engineers are the hidden enablers of everything that we take for granted in modern life."*
Hayaatun Sillem

we should not take our architecture talent for granted

they make most architectural decisions at Adevinta

bridging local business and technology

opportunity: unique, difficult to hire talent (tech + unique domain & organization knowledge),

future Chief Architects, CTOs, heads of engineering

challenge: not naturally connected to other architects outside their units, unclear career path


<br>
### Eyes On, Hands Off<br><span style="font-size: 80%">Preserve Autonomy of Teams, No Secrets</span>
> *“Rather than inject itself in every decision loop, architecture should design mechanisms for teams to make better decisions - they'll know better anyhow, and slowing them down carries a high cost.”*


Organizational structures
Grow and develop talent


“Autonomy does not mean you're all alone and don't align with anyone, don't get feedback from anyone and just do whatever you want.”
