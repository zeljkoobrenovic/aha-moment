> **KEY POINTS:**

https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/if-were-all-so-busy-why-isnt-anything-getting-done?cid=always-pso-twi-mip-mck-tsp-2201-i2a&sid=620fe1dbb603347d3c9dd052&linkId=152829219

I classify the key goals into five categories:

* Maximizing organizational learnings
* Internalizing technology trends
* Increasing transparency and bringing the data on the table
* Improving the quality of decision-making
* Facilitating alignment


### A. Maximizing Organizational Learnings

> *" I expect you to learn to be better each day. I challenge you to look at each working day as an opportunity to learn more, and by doing so, to grow as a person."* -- L. David Marquet
>
> *"Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment."* -- Fred Brooks

One of our primary daily tasks is learning. We need to discover new things about our domain, teams, new tools, and technologies. As individual architects, we need to use each day as an opportunity to learn something new. We need to maximize personal learnings, transforming individual lessons learned into shared guidelines.

One of the problems I frequently see in organizations, particularly complex and international ones, is that they may not have natural spaces for group knowledge sharing. Consequently, architects' superglue attributes may uniquely position them to work together to create spaces for sharing knowledge about architecture and technology. These spaces include but are not limited to regular update calls, knowledge sharing sessions, or conferences.

In addition to creating spaces, as a community, we can further increase our learnings' value by deriving generalized insights from cross-group cases.

I also believe that learning should also have an external component. We need to expose our knowledge externally. With external exposure, we promote what we are doing, and we get valuable external feedback. We need to look for opportunities to give talks, blog, or organize meetups.




### B. Internalizing Technology Trends

> *"The world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it can't be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it."* --Elbert Hubbard

Learning should not be only about our internal activities. We need to know what is going in the world and bring new ideas back home. One of the problems that many organizations face is that due to their complexity and size, they have more challenges in introducing new technologies compared to their disruptors (Figure 3). We have less time to understand and utilize new technology developments while the number of new technologies is increasing due to, e.g., continuous and accelerating evolution of cloud and mobile products.

As architects, we need to be proactive in the identification of relevant new technology developments. Based on our understanding of these developments, we need to create pragmatic technology recommendations for concrete platforms and across the organization.

### C. Increasing Transparency and Bringing the Data

> *"If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine."* -— Jim Barksdale

I genuinely believe that we should make our decision process as much as possible data-drive. Consequently, I see it as one of the most critical tasks to maintain high-quality data on relevant technology development, both internally and externally, providing fuel for data-driven decision-making.

One of the problems we face is that we have lots of data on technology, but they are not well connected, and manual data input and gathering are still frequent. For that reason, we need to work on developing automated tools that facilitate insights into technology and business. 

In my recent positions, I've always aimed to get reliable data about technology with as much as possible automation. Some examples of tools I built and used include:
* Source code contains an incredible amount of information about technology, people activity, team dependencies, and the quality of software systems. To get insights by pragmatic code analyses, I've started and still actively maintain the project [Sokrates](https://sokrates.dev).
* Public cloud usage reposts (e.g., billing reports), providing overview and trends on which team uses which services, regions, budgets.
* Incident reports, looking at trends and dependencies among incidents.
* Key business metrics, like the vibrancy.
* Slack activity to understand team interactions.

I consider the [data and transparency](../ddad), together with architects, to be two main pillars of technology governance (Figure 4). Data and transparency provide a basis for data-informed decision-making. People enable governance to have an impact. Without these two strong pillars, the architecture becomes an abstract ivory tower exercise.

### D. Improving Quality of Decision-Making

> *"Most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using their gut. They will be either lucky or wrong."* -– Suhail Doshi

We cannot centrally make all decisions. One-size-fits-all solutions do not work for everyone, and central decision-making does not scale. But we can at least make sure that the quality of decision-making is high.

BEFORE making a decision

In line with becoming more data-driven, we need to create shared frameworks to move from opinion-based decisions to data-driven economic risk modeling. Such frameworks should achieve the following:
* dismantle the buzzwords, present the problem in clear terms, understandable to a broader audience
* identify the real drivers behind buzzwords based on internal and external research
* bring internal data and external trends
* translate drivers into an economic risk model, and use the model to find the best spot for the given business context

In practice, I expect architects to be in continuous motion through organization layers and interact with diverse stakeholders (Figure 5). We need to work with business functions to define strategy, with other architects to define shared guiding principles, and with developers to ensure consistency among their practical decisions.

### E. Alignment

> *"Excessive complexity is nature's punishment for organizations that are unable to make decisions."
> <br>-- Gregor Hohpe*

In some cases, it makes perfect sense to make decisions together. We work on very similar issues but frequently reinvent the wheel. The goals of a community should be to prevent needled creativity to focus the work and creativity on making a difference for customers and business. In particular, architects must help align the organization on key strategic activities, e.g., cloud strategy, data strategy, or database technology choices.
