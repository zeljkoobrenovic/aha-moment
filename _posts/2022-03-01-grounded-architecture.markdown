The main goal of our approach is to avoid becoming disconnected from the organization, which in a fast moving, global and diverse settings is a real danger. In other words, we wanted to have an architecture function that is well-grounded in the organization. 

Let's revisit the illustrates of the Grounded Architecture model, consisting of three elements:
* The Data Platform,
* The People Platform,
* The Strategy and Governance Platform.

The **Data Platform** represents the transparency pillar. The data platform grounds the architecture in the organization by ensuring that any decisions are based on real-time and complete overview of the state of the technology. The [separate section](data-platform) provides more details of this platform. 

The **People Platform** is another essential element of Grounded architecture. As noted by Gregor Hohpe, to transform an organization, you do not need to solve mathematical equations. Having a strong network of people doing architecture across the organization is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact. 

Lastly, the **Strategy and Governance Platform** does all the things that architecture typically does, leveraging data and people platform to create data-informed, organization-wide impact. [This section](governance) provides more details on Technology Strategy and Governance platform. While the Strategy and Governance platform by name looks most like a typical architecture function, I coinsider such platform is useless without the strong Data and People platforms. With data and propper connections with key individuals, and Strategy and Governance becomes a typical ivory tower, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.
