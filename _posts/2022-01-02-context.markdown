> *"My purpose is to exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished."* --Berrand Russel, The History of Western Philosophy

To better understand any idea and or a solution, it is crucial to understand the context in which these ideas developed. Our hybrid approach to creating a global architecture function is not an abstract idea. Instead, it is the generalization of many lessons learned while solving specific problems in a particular context.

The work I present here is a reflection on my as a Principal Architect at eBay Classifieds and Adevinta. After a year working for eBay Classifeids, Adevinta and eBay Classifies merged, where I continued the same work on a bigger scale. In this section, we discuss critical characteristics of the organizational context that have had an impact on our defining our hybrid approach:
* **global scale**: operating across multiple countries and continents
* **decentralized, loosely-coupled organizational units**: organizational units are decentralized and have significant autonomy, while central functions exist but are limited (everyone is a minority)
* **multi-dimensional diversity**: due to historical reasons, our organizations were very diverse at all levels, including customers, workforce, business model, team topologies, technology stacks
* **synergies and transformation pressures**: our organizations wanted to exploit the benefits from the economies of scale and to reduce duplication of efforts
* **non-linear growth dynamics**: in addition to organic growth, our organizations frequently changed the portfolio both by mergers and acquisitions of new businesses and as well as by divestments

In the following sub-sections, I discuss these characteristics and some of the challenges and opportunities they introduce.

<br>

## Characteristic 1: Global Scale

The first characteristic of the context is that we developed our approach in genuinely global and multicultural organizations. Globality and multiculturality come from two sources:

* Markets in which our organization operates. For example, Adevinta operates in more than 15 countries on five continents.
* Workforce building our products. In addition to the people in each of our active market, we also had people working from countries we do not operate in. With possibility for remote working, there were practically no limitations to where our workforce could be from .

Global context also led to massive scale:
* Billions of monthly user visits
* Thousands of active software developers
* Hundreds of product and development teams
* Hundreds of millions of lines of source code

**Opportunities**

The global scale introduces several exciting opportunities:

* Increasing effectiveness: possibilities to reducing effort duplication by centralizing shared activities
* Leveraging economies of scale: achieving cost advantages, for instance, by increasing effectiveness or reducing unit prices of technology
* Increased business resilience and flexibility: possibility to compensate for negative local market changes with global resources
* Bigger talent pool to support any local or global effort
* Possibility for non-linear growth by mergers and acquisitions (M&As)


**Challenges**

The global and massive scale has many challenges for architectural activities:
* Organizational complexity (e.g., thousands of possible communication channels)
* Complex technology landscape (e.g., the number of services and interconnections)
* Continuously high costs of workforce
* Continuously high cost of computing resources
* Complexity of running operations with high customer demands
* Huge attack surface, many points on the boundary of our systems where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data.
* Limitations of any manual process, such as diagram drawing, to create an overview of the organizational or technology landscape

## Characteristic 2: Loose Coupling

Researcher Karl Weick developed the concepts of tight and loose coupling to describe the organizational structure in educational institutions, but the same concept can be applied to businesses. According to Weick, a tightly coupled organization has a set of mutually understood rules enforced by an inspection and feedback systems. In tightly coupled organizations, management can more directly coordinate all the activities of different departments according to a central strategy. 

In a loosely coupled organization, some of the elements of a tightly coupled organization are not in effect. Employees have more autonomy, and different departments may operate without much coordination.

Due to historical and strategic reasons most of the organizational units are loosely coupled. Our companies frequently grow by acquisition of key player in different marketplaces. Our strategy promotes more independent evolution of each marketplace to better and faster address local market needs. That means that each of our marketplaces has a high level of autonomy, with their own development teams, C(P)TOs, CFOs, CMOs, or CEOs. 

**Opportunities**

Loose coupling offers several advantages:
* Higher flexibility: as marketplaces can keep developing independetly addressing specifc needs without the need to synchronize with other marketplaces.
* High development speed, faster time-to-market: less dependecies makes it much easier for marketplaces to change and evolve their products for specific local needs.
* Innovation

**Challenges**

Loose coupling also has aseveral disadvanteges:
* Duplication of effort: while local maket needs are diffeerent, there is a significant overlap in domains, produce features and technology. This leads to duplcaiton of effort as each marketplace creates their own solution for essentially the same problems.
* Increase in accidental diversity: lasck of synchronization offer flexibility, but may lead to significantly different design choices, making it difficult to consoldate soltuions, move people between teams, or benefit from the economy of scale.
* Limited possibilities for central control: due to less dependcies and different goals, it is difficult to introduce changes accross the whoel portfolio.

## Characteristic 3: Multi-Dimensional Diversity

Our organization was very divers accross several dimensions:
* Cultural diversity
* Organizational diversity
* Product diversity
* Technical diversity

The global and multicultural nature of our context poses several interesting challenges that any approach to scaling architecture needs to address:
* Diversity of decision-making styles
* Diversity of organizational styles and hierarchies
* Diversity of meeting styles
* Diversity of ways of dealing with feedback

Another dimension of diversity is organisational styles. We were organised in several units including marketplaces (each with their own structures) global capabilities, enterprise IT teams, data capabilities, infrastructure. In addition to thier loose coupling, these organisational units differed in multiple ways:
* Sizes, groups having hundreds of developers to groups having only a dozen
* Team topologies, some organisations having one team other dozens
* Position of architecture, with some organisations having architecture teams and lead architects, smaller units have their team members conducting architecture activities by in addition to other responsibilities


Product diversity
* Products and features


Each part of the organization has a different history and a different legacy.

Technical infrastructure:
* Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) in combination with custom build private data centers

Application technology diversity
* Database technologies (e.g., MySQL, Postgress, MongoDB, Cassandra, AWS RDS)
* Backend programming languages (e.g., Java, C#, Go, Scala, PHP, Node.js, Kotlin)
* Mobile apps programming languages (e.g., Swift, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Flutter/Dart)
* Frontend programming languages and frameworks (e.g., React, Android, AndroidJS, Vue, jQuery)



Diversity has many impacts on architectural activities, primarily:
* Increasing complexity and cognitive load of teams
* High amount of technical debt due to many legacy components
* Limited flexibility and reorganization possibilities as expertize is split among many domains and technologies

**Opportunities**

* Innovation
* Addressing local needs better

**Challenges**

* Complexity
* More expensive:
* Less talent density arround key topics

<br>



## Characteristic 4: Synergies and Transformations Pressures

Complex organizations do not grow just to be bigger. Rather benefits, like cost synergies or increased capacity for innovation are expected. 

Provide focused tech strategy leadership to support strategic transformations

Aligning organizations, technology, product, and business functions


** Opportunities**

* Cost reduction
* Acceleration due to more resource available for specific work
* Innovation
* Scaling

**Challenges**

* Up-front investments
* High costs and risks of change
* Slowing down the teams during the synergy transfomrations
* Slowing down the teams due to more dependencies


## Characteristic 5: Non-Linear Growth Dynamics

Complex organizations are frequently very dynamic, and in a trivial sense, any organization is dynamic. But a reference organization I use in this section grows (or shrinks) and reorganizes frequently and significantly.

They change both organically and inorganically. Organic growth is internal growth the company sees from its operations. Inorganic growth is growth from buying other businesses or opening new locations. Another direction is also happening, for instance, divestments to increase focus.

Furthermore, due to its global nature, such organizations are more likely to be affected by international events and many local events.


**Opportunities**

* Faster growth
* Speeding up innovation


**Challenges**
 Nonlinear dynamics have several influences on architectural activities:
* Increased complexity due to new organizational unit
* Increased complexity to potentially more diverse organization, process and technology
* How to increase synergies after the acquisition
* How to architecture for synergies but stay flexible when the organization decides to divest a part of the organization
