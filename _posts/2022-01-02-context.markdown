> *"My purpose is to exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished."* --Berrand Russel, The History of Western Philosophy

To better understand any idea and or a solution, it is good to understand the context in which these ideas developed. The solutions discussed later are not out-of-blue abstract ideas but are the results of generalizing solutions to specific problems in particular types of contexts.

A hybrid approach to scaling architecture generalizes my experiences in several complex organizations. These organizations were global and truly multicultural; they operated on a massive scale; they were very diverse; and dynamic (Figure 1).

***Figure 1:** The Context of an organizations suitable for a Hybrid Approach: Global & Multi-Cultural + Massive Scale + Diverse + Dynamic.* 

In the following sections, I discuss these characteristics and some of the challenges they bring in more detail.

# A global, multi-cultural organization

The first characteristic of our context is that we developed our approach in a truly global and multicultural organization. Globality and multiculturality come from two sources:

* Markets in which our organization operates. For example, Adevinta operates in more than 15 countries on four continents.
* Workforce building our products. In addition to the crew in each active market, we also had people working from countries we do not operate.

At some point, I interacted with people from more than 20 countries on five continents.

The global and multicultural nature of our context poses several interesting challenges that any approach to scaling architecture needs to address:
* Different decision-making styles
* Different organizational styles and hierarchies
* Different meeting styles
* Different ways of dealing with feedback

# Massive Size

Another characteristic of the context that developed the hybrid approach is massive scale. By massive scale, we mean all specific aspects of scale:
* Millions of active daily users
* Billions of monthly user visits
* Thousands of active software developers
* Hundreds of product and development teams
* Hundreds of millions of lines of source code

The massive scale has many challenges for architectural activities:
* The high complexity of the technology landscape (number of components and interconnections)
* The increased complexity of communication between teams (impossible to have all people in the same room, thousands of communication channels)
* Limitations of manual data collection (e.g., sending a sheet to feel in the data)
* Limitations of manual processes, such as diagram drawing to create an overview of the technology landscape


# Multi-Dimensional Diversity

The organization we use as a reference context is not only operating on a global, massive scale but is very diverse. The diversity has multiple dimensions:
* Cultures and market characteristics
* Products and features
* Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) in combination with custom build private data centers
* Database technologies (e.g., MySQL, Postgress, MongoDB, Cassandra, AWS RDS)
* Backend programming languages (e.g., Java, C#, Go, Scala, PHP, Node.js, Kotlin)
* Mobile apps programming languages (e.g., Swift, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Flutter/Dart)
* Frontend programming languages and frameworks (e.g., React, Android, AndroidJS, Vue, jQuery)

Another source of diversity is a rich history. Each part of the organization has a different history and a different legacy.

Diversity has many impacts on architectural activities, primarily:
* Increasing complexity and cognitive load of teams
* High amount of technical debt due to many legacy components
* Limited flexibility and reorganization possibilities as expertize is split among many domains and technologies


# Dynamic

Complex organizations are frequently very dynamic. In a trivial sense, any organization is dynamic. But a reference organization I use in this section grows (or shrinks) and reorganizes frequently and significantly.

They change both organically and inorganically. Organic growth is internal growth the company sees from its operations. Inorganic growth is growth from buying other businesses or opening new locations. Another direction is also happening, for instance, divestments to increase focus.

Furthermore, due to its global nature, such organizations are more likely to be affected by international events and many local events.

Dynamic aspects  have several influences on architectural activities:
* How to onboard new markets
* How to increase synergies after the acquisition
* How to architecture for synergies but stay flexible when the organization decides to divest a part of the organization


## Synergies and Strategic Transformations

Lastly, complex organizations do not grow just to be bigger. Rather benefits, like cost synergies or increased capacity for innovation are expected. 

Provide focused tech strategy leadership to support strategic transformations

Aligning organizations, technology, product, and business functions
