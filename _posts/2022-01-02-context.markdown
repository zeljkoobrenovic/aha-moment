excerpt: A hybrid approach to scaling architecture generalizes my experiences in several complex organizations. These organizations were global and truly multicultural; they operated on a massive scale; they were very diverse; and dynamic.

> *"My purpose is to exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished."* --Berrand Russel, The History of Western Philosophy


To better understand any idea and or a solution, it is crucial to understand the context in which these ideas developed.

Our hybrid approach to creating a global architecture function is not an abstract idea. Instead, it is the generalization of many lessons learned while solving specific problems in a particular context.

In this section, we discuss critical characteristics of the organizational context that have had an impact on our defining our hybrid approach:
* **global scale**: operating across multiple countries and continents
* **decentralized, loosely-coupled organizational units**: organizational units are decentralized and have significant autonomy, while central functions exist but are limited (everyone is a minority)
* **multi-dimensional diversity**: due to historical reasons, our organizations were very diverse at all levels, including customers, workforce, business model, team topologies, technology stacks
* **non-linear growth dynamics**: in addition to organic growth, our organizations frequently change the portfolio both by mergers and acquisitions of new businesses and as well as by divestments
* **synergies and transformation pressures**: our organizations wanted to exploit the benefits from the economies of scale and to reduce duplication of efforts

In the following sub-sections, I discuss these characteristics and some of the challenges and opportunities they introduce.

<br>

## Characteristic 1: Global Scale

The first characteristic of our context is that we developed our approach in genuinely global and multicultural organizations. Globality and multiculturality come from two sources:

* Markets in which our organization operates. For example, Adevinta operates in more than 15 countries on five continents.
* Workforce building our products. In addition to the crew in each active market, we also had people working from countries we do not operate. There were practically no limitations to where our workforce could be from with remote working.

Another characteristic of the context that developed the hybrid approach is massive scale:
* Billions of monthly user visits
* Thousands of active software developers
* Hundreds of product and development teams
* Hundreds of millions of lines of source code

**Opportunities**

The global scale introduces several exciting opportunities:

* Increasing effectiveness: possibilities to reducing effort duplication by centralizing shared activities
* Leveraging economies of scale: achieving cost advantages, for instance, by increasing effectiveness or reducing unit prices of technology
* Increased business resilience and flexibility: possibility to compensate for negative local market changes with global resources
* Bigger talent pool to support any local or global effort
* Possibility for non-linear growth by mergers and acquisitions (M&As)


**Challenges**

The global and massive scale has many challenges for architectural activities:
* Organizational complexity (e.g., thousands of possible communication channels)
* Complex technology landscape (e.g., the number of services and interconnections)
* Continuously high costs of workforce
* Continuously high cost of computing resources
* Complexity of running operations with high customer demands
* Huge attack surface, many points on the boundary of our systems where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data.
* Limitations of any manual process, such as diagram drawing, to create an overview of the organizational or technology landscape


<br>

## Characteristic 2: Loosely Coupled Units

Researcher Karl Weick developed the concepts of tight and loose coupling to describe the organizational structure in educational institutions, but the same concept can be applied to businesses. According to Weick, a tightly coupled organization has a set of mutually understood rules enforced by an inspection and feedback system. In tightly coupled organizations, management can more directly coordinate all the activities of different departments according to a central strategy. 

In a loosely coupled organization, some of the elements of a tightly coupled organization are not in effect. Employees have more autonomy, and different departments may operate without much coordination.

Due to historical and strategic reasons most of the organizational units are loosely coupled.

**Opportunities**

Flexibility
Speed
Innovation

**Challenges**

* Duplication of effort
* Increase in accidental diversity
* Limited possibilites to control the units centrally.


<br>

## Characteristic 3: Multi-Dimensional Diversity

The global and multicultural nature of our context poses several interesting challenges that any approach to scaling architecture needs to address:
* Different decision-making styles
* Different organizational styles and hierarchies
* Different meeting styles
* Different ways of dealing with feedback
* 
The organization we use as a reference context is not only operating on a global, massive scale but is very diverse. The diversity has multiple dimensions:
* Cultures and market characteristics

Product diversity
* Products and features

Technical infrastructure:
* Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) in combination with custom build private data centers

Application technology diversity
* Database technologies (e.g., MySQL, Postgress, MongoDB, Cassandra, AWS RDS)
* Backend programming languages (e.g., Java, C#, Go, Scala, PHP, Node.js, Kotlin)
* Mobile apps programming languages (e.g., Swift, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Flutter/Dart)
* Frontend programming languages and frameworks (e.g., React, Android, AndroidJS, Vue, jQuery)

Another source of diversity is a rich history. Each part of the organization has a different history and a different legacy.

Diversity has many impacts on architectural activities, primarily:
* Increasing complexity and cognitive load of teams
* High amount of technical debt due to many legacy components
* Limited flexibility and reorganization possibilities as expertize is split among many domains and technologies

<br>


## Characteristic 4: Non-Linear Growth Dynamics

Complex organizations are frequently very dynamic. In a trivial sense, any organization is dynamic. But a reference organization I use in this section grows (or shrinks) and reorganizes frequently and significantly.

They change both organically and inorganically. Organic growth is internal growth the company sees from its operations. Inorganic growth is growth from buying other businesses or opening new locations. Another direction is also happening, for instance, divestments to increase focus.

Furthermore, due to its global nature, such organizations are more likely to be affected by international events and many local events.

Dynamic aspects  have several influences on architectural activities:
* How to onboard new markets
* How to increase synergies after the acquisition
* How to architecture for synergies but stay flexible when the organization decides to divest a part of the organization


## Characteristic 5: Synergies and Transformations Pressures

Lastly, complex organizations do not grow just to be bigger. Rather benefits, like cost synergies or increased capacity for innovation are expected. 

Provide focused tech strategy leadership to support strategic transformations

Aligning organizations, technology, product, and business functions
