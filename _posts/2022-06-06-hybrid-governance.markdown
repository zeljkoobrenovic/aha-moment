## Typical Technology Strategy and Governance Actvities

* Supporting merger and acquisitions (M&A) activities with expertize and analyses
* Defining vision and direction of technology, frequently in collaboration with CTOs
* Performing SWOT and other analyses of platforms and system
* Cloud Strategy, Data Strategy, Platform Strategy
* ...

## Flexible Governance

We wanted to create a governance model that acknowledges the complexity and diversity of our organization. By governing, we mean guiding technology choices in the organization in a particular direction aligned with the technology strategies. We tried to prevent a simplistic view of architecture as defining directives for the rest of the organization.

Consequently, we aimed at promoting a technology governance model as a well-balanced hybrid of three different ways of governing:
* mandates and bans,
* taxes, and
* leading by context.


## Mandates and Bans

Governing with mandates and bans means defining what people should or should not do. In our context, such mandates and bans have a place to define broader strategic boundaries of choices that people can make. For instance, limiting the usage of public cloud providers to specific vendors or following strict security procedures should be explicitly defined and controlled. The role of architecture in this form of governing should be to participate in defining manates and bans with strategic stakeholders and to create clarity about mandates and bans and create transparency.


## Taxation

Governing with taxes is a form of guiding in which people are not forbidden to make some decisions but need to pay some form of taxes on used resources. For instance, costs of the public cloud usage could be cross-charged across the organization, providing a helpful feedback loop to optimize our systems and avoid unnecessary resource consumption, avoiding "tragedy of commons" which frequently happens when there are not limits or significant costs of increasing shared resource consumption (e.g., public cloud budget). The role of architecture in this form of governance should be to create efficient feedback loops on key metrics related to taxes.


## Leading by Context

Leading the context is a form of governing in which we do not forbid people to make some choices, nor do they need to pay taxes. Instead, we wanted to create a shared context that can facilitate people making informed decisions. Such contexts should include sharing of lessons learned by others, both good and bad, and places to get feedback on ideas and plans. The role of the architecture in this form of governing should be to create mechanisms for sharing experiences and obtaining feedback on plans and decisions. It should also include mechanisms to capture artifacts that can help people to make informed decisions, such as architecture decision resources (ADRs), principles, golden paths, or best practices.
