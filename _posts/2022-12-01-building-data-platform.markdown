Two extremes:
* no data
* too much data (or to much details)

My approach to make a data plafrom success:

* "Talk is expensive. Show me the code." Start with the source code, scan as soon as possible all source code using tools as Sokrates. I highly recommend Sokrates as the basis for the data platform, but other simples analyses could also provide good starting point. Modern IT enterprises store almost everything as acode. It is the richest and most up-to-date documentation on most things happening the enterprise.
* Connect with finance and governance teams to get exports of their data. Cloud billing reports, and data about vibrancy or revenue streams are collected anyway. By extracting more technology oreinted data connecting (e.g., publci cloud technolgy usage trends) and connecting them to other data, many new insights may be obtained without starting any new processes or asking peopl to provide more details. First leverage what you have, squeez all the value from it, then ask peopl for any missing elements.
* Use simple and easy to maintain infrastructures. For example, I publish results of Sokrates analyses and other simple data Web apps as static resources in our enterprise GithHub pages. Configuring more complex infrastructure swith complex databases, and backend software resuires more maintanance.
* Maintain the culture of transparency. It is much simpler an more effecting to share less data with everyone, than to have more data but with a complex authorization.
