## Mission

"*Create transparency around the state of technology and architecture across organization and execute on the technology strategy aligned with organizational Objectives. The VAT represents the technical conscience of the organization.*"

Activities

Here are some of the ways in which the VAT contributes to eCG's bottom line:
* Alignment of architecture descriptions and use of technology
* Tracking and reduction of technical debt
* Short-term projects in the form of Special Interest Groups and bootcamps
* Learning through content sharing and architecture summits
* Measuring performance through metrics (collected manually and automatically)

## Gluing Together Superglue Architects in Strong Communities

> Do not underestimate the power of building community and authentic relationships.

Architects are always a part of some team, where they may be the only architects. But they can and should collaborate globally with architects in other units. For instance, I work with a virtual team of architects. In this peer-to-peer community, we were collectively responsible for identifying and growing architectural talent, mentoring, and helping each other. 

While the exact structure of communities may differ per organization and change over time, it is crucial to keep developing such groups as a vibrant, diverse community where they can leverage and build on each other's work. 

As a strong community, such a group can transform individual experiences into collective knowledge that can benefit the whole organization.
