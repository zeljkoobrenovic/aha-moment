> *”Architecture is not so much about the software, but about the people who write the software. The core principles of architecture, such as coupling and cohesion, aren't about the code. The code doesn't 'care' about how cohesive or decoupled it is; ... But people do care about their coupling to other team members.”* - James O. Coplien

One of the central premises off our work is that we should not take our architecture talent for granted. Architects are bridging local business, product, organisational and technology issues. Architects are difficult to hire talent as, to operate properly, they need both, the in-depth technical knowledge as well as domain-specific and organizational knowledge.

## Central vs. Federated

The architecture function is generally based on one of two fundamental models: central and federated ([McKinsey 2022](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/crafting-the-optimal-model-for-the-it-architecture-organization)).

The central model involves a large-scale central architecture team that defines the process and artifacts required for approval of new work and ensures adherence by development teams. In this model, development teams themselves may have few or no qualified solution architects, as this role is consolidated within the central architecture team. Further, centralized teams for related roles, such as infrastructure, operations, and security, are also held apart from the development function. Control and governance are typically the primary concerns of the central enterprise architecture team.

By contrast, the federated model generally relies upon a guild or “community of practice” of solution architects embedded into individual development teams. The guild may be complemented by a small central architecture team or architecture center of excellence (CoE). The federated model’s enterprise architects facilitate only the most high-level planning and artifact creation and act as on-demand service providers to support distributed teams.

In this model, which is more commonly associated with cross-functional DevOps culture, the roles of solution and enterprise architects are generally broader in an effort to integrate the related concerns of infrastructure, operations, and security in product-oriented teams. This kind of architect role is focused more on facilitation and enablement than control, as the number of solution architects in a federated environment typically dwarfs the number of enterprise architects.

Today, we see modern agile organizations most commonly adopt the federated model. This approach increases the likelihood that the central architecture team will spend its time where it should, staying closely involved with the remediation of challenges identified in the teams, such as infrastructure or development. In addition, the concept of central standards and maintaining a chapter of architects is much more closely aligned with the principles of agile than the models where most of the capacity is hosted in a central team. In addition, the model ensures that the architects will be evaluated against the goals of the individual products they support, thereby ensuring they really focus on improving practical performance and reducing complexity.



To operate in our complex context, we have invested effort to make sure that we have right people at the right places. We have opted for a hybrid organizational morning combining elements of Central and federated orientation structures. Consequently we have free key elements of our people dimension
* Virtual Architectural Teams (VATs),
* Central Architectural Teams (CATs), and
* A Chief Architect (CA)

## Virtual Architecture Team (VAT)

A virtual architectural team is composed of people that work full-time as architects or tech leads in specific organization or units but spending part time collaborating with architects from other units to reach more alignment, share knowledge, and leverage eachs other’s work.

Architects working in a VAT are always a part of some team, where they may be the only architects. But they can and should collaborate globally with architects in other units. In this peer-to-peer community, architects are collectively responsible for identifying and growing architectural talent, mentoring, and helping each other. 

A VAT can transform individual experiences into collective knowledge that can benefit the whole organization.

We have organised architects in several sub-teams:
* General teams, for a broader set of architectural topics. 
* Specialist teams focus on a particular part of technology stack. Examples include native mobile apps, web frontends, public cloud infrastructure, and so forth. 
* Strategic initiatives teams. For instance, data strategy, public cloud strategy, transcations or verticalization.

In general all teams followed similar pattern of rituals:
* regular (e.g., bi-weekly) forums, with updates, announcement of architectural spikes, and sharing or architectural decisions)
* annual or bi-annual summit, with several days of intensive knowledge sharing and workshops
* ad-hoc workshops, focusing on some clear topic

Pros:

Cons:

> *“A lot of cheap seats in the arena are filled with people who never venture onto the floor. They just hurl mean-spirited criticisms and put-downs from a safe distance. ... we need to be selective about the feedback we let into our lives. For me, if you’re not in the arena getting your ass kicked, I’m not interested in your feedback.”* — Brené Brown, Rising Strong

While we have provided some basic support, we found it critical that all communities take initiative and engage as much as possible people during these events. We wanted to prevent people just being passive receivers of information, but to actively engage.


## Central Architecture Team

In a central teams, we aimed at having a small number (less than 5) of people with droad experience, including hands on technical experiences. People who are well connected in the organization and externally, good communicators, and have a political acumen.

While the roles of people in central teams may differ, in general we aim at the following types of responsibilities:
* Identify, connect and maintain relationships with all relevant domain stakeholders
* Domain concept ownership: clarity, communication, resources
* Promotes data-informed domain decisions: identify, collect, use relevant data about the domain
* Influence all significant project in the domain (but no project management responsibilities)
* Internal community building around the domain
* External thought leadership
* Vendor relationships and roadmap alignment

Pros:

Cons:

## Chief Architect

Lastly, our model has a role of chief architect. The Chief Architect has two main areas of responsibilities:
* to make other architect work well. Rather than inject itself in every decision loop, architecture should design mechanisms for teams to make better decisions - they'll know better anyhow, and slowing them down carries a high cost. In this context, CA is a Curator, Role-model, and Catalyst
* working on the most important strategic initiatives: strategix, M&As
