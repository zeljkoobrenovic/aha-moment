## Mission

"*Create transparency around the state of technology and architecture across organization and execute on the technology strategy aligned with organizational Objectives. The VAT represents the technical conscience of the organization.*"

Activities

Here are some of the ways in which the VAT contributes to eCG's bottom line:
* Alignment of architecture descriptions and use of technology
* Tracking and reduction of technical debt
* Short-term projects in the form of Special Interest Groups and bootcamps
* Learning through content sharing and architecture summits
* Measuring performance through metrics (collected manually and automatically)

## Gluing Together Superglue Architects in Strong Communities

> Do not underestimate the power of building community and authentic relationships.

Architects are always a part of some team, where they may be the only architects. But they can and should collaborate globally with architects in other units. For instance, I work with a virtual team of architects. In this peer-to-peer community, we were collectively responsible for identifying and growing architectural talent, mentoring, and helping each other. 

While the exact structure of communities may differ per organization and change over time, it is crucial to keep developing such groups as a vibrant, diverse community where they can leverage and build on each other's work. 

As a strong community, such a group can transform individual experiences into collective knowledge that can benefit the whole organization.

## Principles
<br>
## People, People, People<br><span style="font-size: 80%">Strong Architecture = Strong Architects</span>
> *”Architecture is not so much about the software, but about the people who write the software. The core principles of architecture, such as coupling and cohesion, aren't about the code. The code doesn't 'care' about how cohesive or decoupled it is; ... But people do care about their coupling to other team members.”* - James O. Coplien

> *"Engineers are the hidden enablers of everything that we take for granted in modern life."*
Hayaatun Sillem

we should not take our architecture talent for granted

they make most architectural decisions at Adevinta

bridging local business and technology

opportunity: unique, difficult to hire talent (tech + unique domain & organization knowledge),

future Chief Architects, CTOs, heads of engineering

challenge: not naturally connected to other architects outside their units, unclear career path

## No Architect Left Behind<br><span style="font-size: 80%">Global, inclusive operational model

> *“A lot of cheap seats in the arena are filled with people who never venture onto the floor. They just hurl mean-spirited criticisms and put-downs from a safe distance. ... we need to be selective about the feedback we let into our lives. For me, if you’re not in the arena getting your ass kicked, I’m not interested in your feedback.”* — Brené Brown, Rising Strong: The Reckoning. The Rumble. The Revolution

Separation between community and team activities

Architecture is tough, critique is easy

Talent density

## Eyes On, Hands Off<br><span style="font-size: 80%">Preserve Autonomy of Teams, No Secrets</span>
> *“Rather than inject itself in every decision loop, architecture should design mechanisms for teams to make better decisions - they'll know better anyhow, and slowing them down carries a high cost.”*


Organizational structures
Grow and develop talent


“Autonomy does not mean you're all alone and don't align with anyone, don't get feedback from anyone and just do whatever you want.”

### Lead By Context / Provide Broader Context

Define a broad context with mandates and bans
Collaborative nudges

Ruthless transparency
VAT forums (Architecture Spikes, Decisions Sharing, Tools and processes)

Preserve decision culture

### Distributed Decision-Making with Publicity Principle
