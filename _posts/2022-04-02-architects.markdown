> *”Architecture is not so much about the software, but about the people who write the software. The core principles of architecture, such as coupling and cohesion, aren't about the code. The code doesn't 'care' about how cohesive or decoupled it is; ... But people do care about their coupling to other team members.”* -James O. Coplien

Superglue as a flavor all architects should aim at adoptin while keeping their original architecture style (i.e., architecture topology)

A nudge how to furtehr develop as architect

The people are the central and the essential part of all architecture activities. Developing architecture as a discipline in an IT organization requires having competent, empowered, and motivated architects. In other words, Strong Architecture = Strong Architects.

Scaling architecture practice requires some clarity and organizational alignment on:
* what it means to be an architect, and
* how architects need to develop.

While we acknowledge that due to complex and dynamic nature of organitzaion, architects will operate differently in diverse parts of the organization, we wanted to create a same mindset on the role of the architecture. The superglue metaphor serves that purpose. 


In the next section, I elaborate on the role of individual architects. Then, I describe how I think we should develop architects. Lastly, I discuss the importance of creating a community of architects and describe expected architects' activities in more detail.


## Architects

In my view, architects in IT organizations should develop as "superglue." I borrow this view from [Adam Bar-Niv and Amir Shenhav from Intel](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetID=454541). They pointed out that instead of the superhero, we need "super glue" architects - the fellows who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.

The superglue characteristics mean serving as the organizational connective tissue, linking the "business wheelhouse" and the "engine room." Architects, of course, need to be technically strong. But their unique strengths should stem from being able to relate, or glue, technical issues with business and broader issues.

From discussions I've had with our technology leaders, engineers, architects, the picture below has crystallized as a representation of the "superglue" metaphor for architects (Figure 1).

***Figure 1:** Architects serve as a superglue, connecting development teams with business stakeholders while also linking their teams with the internal communities and the external world.*

IT organizations need persons who look broader, linking architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together. These persons may not necessarily have a title of an architect. But they need to have good working relationships with developer teams and the local business stakeholders and functions. Simultaneously, such a person is well connected with the internal communities and has external visibility. They promote what we are doing, and on the other hand, they bring back the ideas from the outside.


## Developing Architect as Superglue

Setting the architects' goals to be "superglue" also requires some thought on developing as a superglue. Borrowing from Gregor Hohpe's view on architect development from his book Software Architecture Elevator, I share the view that our architects should stand on three legs:

* Skills
* Impact
* Thought leadership

***Figure 2:** Architect Profile: Skils + Impact + Thought Leadership.*

#### Skills 
Architects have to have proper skill sets. By skills, I mean possessing knowledge and the ability to apply relevant knowledge in practice. These skills should include both technical (e.g., cloud architecture or Kubernetes technology) as well as communication and influence skills.  

#### Impact

Impact should be measured as a benefit for the business. Architects need to ensure that what they are doing profits the business. New architects start as students or trainees having skills but little impact. But sooner than later, fresh architects need to get out into the world and make an impact. Architects that do not make an impact do not have a place in a for-profit business.

#### Though leadership

Thought leadership acknowledges that experienced architects should do more than make architecture. This "more" can have different forms but should include at least some of the following activities: mentoring junior architects and engineers, publishing articles, giving talks, starting initiatives, and driving decisions.

Architects need to have minimal "length" of all of these "legs" to be successful. For instance, having skills and impact without leadership frequently leads to hitting a glass ceiling. Such architects plateau at an intermediate level and cannot lead the company to innovative or transformative solutions. Leadership without impact lacks foundation and may signal that you have become an ivory tower architect with a weak relation to reality.

In all scenarios, it is crucial for an organization that a senior architect mentors junior architects. Feedback cycles in (software) architecture are inherently slow. Mentoring can save new architects many years of learning by doing and making mistakes [Hohpe 2020].
