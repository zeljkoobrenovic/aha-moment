To operate effectively in [our context](context), we were considering several options for defining a cross-organizational architecture operating model. The main goal of our approach is to avoid becoming disconnected from the organization, which is a fast moving, global and diverse settings is a real danger. In other words, we wanted to have an architecture function that is well-grounded in the organization. 

Figure 1 illustrates the Grounded Architecture model, consisting of three elements:
* The Data Platform,
* The People Platform,
* The Strategy and Governance Platform.

The **Data Platform** represents the transparency pillar. The data platform grounds the architecture in the organization by ensuring that any decisions are based on real-time and complete overview of the state of the technology. The [separate section](data-platform) provides more details of this platform. 

The **People Platform** is another essential element of Grounded architecture. As noted by Gregor Hohpe, to transform an organization, you do not need to solve mathematical equations. You need to move people. Consequently, having a strong network of people doing architecture across the organization is crucial to ensure that architecture function has any tangible impact. In my work in past few years, I was working by combining, in different forms, two teams of architects: a small central architecture team, as well as a cross-organizational distributed virtual team. A central architecture team serves as an enabler for the rest of the organization, helping accelerate strategic transformations. A distributed virtual architecture team consists of architects (or other people making architecture decisions in their teams) working in local organizational units but spending some time (e.g. 10-20%) in a virtual team with peers from other teams. I found that such a distributed virtual architecture team is a crucial element of an architecture function, as it provides the connection (grounding) across the all parts and levels of the organization, increasing the visibility and connections, and making it easier to implement change across the organization. [This section](people) elaborates more on the distributed virtual architecture team. 

Lastly, the **Strategy and Governance Platform** does all the things that architecture typically does, leveraging data and people platform to create data-informed, organization-wide impact. [This section](governance) provides more details on Technology Strategy and Governance platform. While the Strategy and Governance platform by name looks most like a typical architecture function, I coinsider such platform is useless without the strong Data and People platforms. With data and propper connections with key individuals, and Strategy and Governance becomes a typical ivory tower, generating opinion-based decisions disconnected from reality.
