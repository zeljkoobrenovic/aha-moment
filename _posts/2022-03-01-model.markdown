> *"Most of us think successful people have more willpower. But all they do is build systems to make hard things easier to do."* - Chris Hladczuk

In this section I will describe how we have approached reaching our goals. We were considering several options on how to define cross organizational double architecture operating model. One approach could be to have a central team or architects, working together as a team define principles used by the rest of organization. Another approach I will still keep architect in local teams either in a form off a matrix organization where architects will report centrally but work with local teams, or report locally but indirectly align with global and another architects. 

We have decided not to follow exclusively one of the two approaches. Rather we have to find a hybrid approach borrowing some elements of the previously to mentioned approaches (Figure 1). Furthermore we introduced a self service data platform providing elaborate near real-time insights about the state of technology and architecture in our orientation. A chief architect in this model is an orchestrator of synergic usage of all these elements, and a gardener making sure that each of these elements is strong and sufficiently developed.

In the following sections we will describe each of these elements in more detail concluding wait modes of operation off these elements.

* Hybrid Architecture Teams (Central + Distributed)
* Hybrid Governance Model (Mandates & Bans + Taxes + Leading by Context)
