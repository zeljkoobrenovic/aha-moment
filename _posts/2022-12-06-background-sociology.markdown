Good background readings...



## Nudge

<img src="assets/images/nudge.webp" style="width: 178px">

We work in the context and at a scale where trying to change things via mandates and bans is ineffective and frequently makes no sense.

We borrow the following concepts:
* the general philosophy of nudges
* the value of choice-preserving approaches, avoid negative effects of bans and mandates
* the choice architect
* the power of defaults
* the publicity principle: exercising freedom in an informed and public way
* make it easy (and automatic)

"A choice architect has the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions."

"the behavioral phenomenon of reactance: when people feel ordered around, they might get mad and do the
opposite of what is being ordered (or even suggested)."

"Default options thus act as powerful nudges."

"The libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that much of the time, and so long as
they are not harming others, people should be free to do what they like—and to opt out of arrangements they
deem undesirable if that is what they want to do. To borrow a phrase from the late Milton Friedman, libertarian
paternalists urge that people should be “free to choose.” We strive to design policies that maintain or increase
freedom of choice."

"we use the word libertarian to mean “choice-preserving.”"

"it’s especially valuable to help people to exercise their freedom in an informed way."

"transparency about nudging does not reduce its impact.11 In fact, it can easily have the opposite effect."

"the publicity principle suggests that no choice architect in the public or private sector should adopt a policy that
she would not be able or willing to defend publicly."

"We have used the term paternalism to include efforts to protect people against their own errors by guiding them
to the choices they would make if they were fully informed and free from behavioral biases."

"The paternalistic aspect lies in the claim that it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people’s
behavior in order to make their lives longer, healthier, and better."

"The paternalistic policies that we favor aim to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as
judged by the choosers themselves."

"A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a
predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as
a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid."

"Nudges are not taxes, fines, subsidies, bans, or mandates. Putting the fruit at eye level counts as a nudge.
Banning junk food does not." - compoarison with formal governance

"the problem is that we are fallible and life[architecture] is hard"

"One of the causes of status quo bias is a lack of attention. Many people often adopt what we call the “yeah,
whatever” heuristic."

"The picture that emerges is one of busy people trying to cope in a complex world in which they cannot afford to
think deeply and at length about every choice they have to make."

"an arbitrary “tradition,” in the form of some judgment about the distance, can become entrenched over time,
which means that many people end up following it notwithstanding its original arbitrariness."

"“collective conservatism”: the tendency of groups to stick to established patterns even as new needs arise."

"If choice architects want to shift behavior and to do so with a nudge, they might be able to achieve this by
simply informing people about what others are thinking and doing. It follows that either desirable or undesirable behavior can often be increased, at least to some extent, by
drawing public attention to what others are doing."

"a norm or practice that is understood to be emerging, or to be increasingly supported, can operate as a powerful
nudge, even if it is not yet supported by a majority."

"A slightly longer answer is that people are most likely to need nudges when decisions require scarce attention,
when decisions are difficult, when people do not get prompt feedback, and when they have trouble translating
aspects of the situation into terms that they can easily understand."

"When people are in situations that are unfamiliar or rare, they might well need a nudge."

"people were more likely to fulfill their goals if they had made explicit “implementation intentions.”"

"When feedback is ineffective, we may benefit from a nudge."

"The discussion thus far suggests that people may most need a good nudge for choices that require memory or
have delayed effects; those that are difficult, are infrequent, and offer poor feedback; and those for which the
relationship between choice and experience is ambiguous."

"good design is often no more expensive than bad design"

**Make It Easy**
"if you want to encourage some action or activity, Make It Easy"

"one of the best ways to make it easy is to make it automatic."

"Architectural solutions, making things easy or automatic, can have a much bigger impact than asking people to
do the right thing."


"A good system of choice architecture helps people to improve their ability to map choices onto outcomes and
hence to select options that will make them better off."

"Structuring choice sometimes means helping people to learn, so they can later make better choices on their own."

"What do successful bookstores (and other small retail establishments) have in common? They are good curators"

"Good curation combines getting rid of bad options and introducing novel ones."

"An ongoing useful role for governments is the creation of standardized units to make comparisons easier for
consumers."

"We have said that people often do not know how much energy they are using. They also do not know how their
energy use compares with that of their neighbors."

"having choices is one thing; making good choices is another."

"ability to control one’s own destiny comes with the responsibility to make good choices."

"Sometimes good choice architecture is simply making life more navigable, making decision tasks as easy as
following the directions on Google Maps. In such cases, the choice architect is not encouraging or discouraging
any particular choice, but instead is just making the process of deciding and implementing as easy as possible."

"whenever we engage in directional nudging, we should be confident that we are likely to make people better off,
as judged by them."

"taxes, subsidies, mandates, and bans also have their place." "we will need jackhammers and bulldozers, with pocketknives helping where they can."

## The Culture Map

<img src="assets/images/the-culture-map.jpeg" style="width: 178px">

"have the innovation from the combination of cultures, while avoiding the inefficiency that comes with the clash of cultures."

"the type of leader who is a facilitator among equals rather than a director giving orders from on high."


"cultural relativity is the key to understanding the impact of culture on human interactions."

"
the ways you seek to persuade others and the kinds of arguments you find persuasive are deeply rooted in your culture’s philosophical, religious, and educational assumptions and attitudes. Far from being universal, then, the art of persuasion is one that is profoundly culture-based."

"In low-context cultures, effective communication must be simple, clear, and explicit in order to effectively pass the message, and most communicators will obey this requirement, usually without being fully conscious of it."

"There is just one easy strategy to remember: Multicultural teams need low-context processes."

"The best moment to develop the processes is when the team is forming, before miscommunication takes place."

"What if you have a blend of many cultures all on one team—Americans who recap incessantly and nail everything down in writing, Japanese who read the air, French who speak at the second degree, British who love to use deadpan irony as a form of humor, and Chinese who learn as young children to beat around the bush?"

"People from all cultures believe in “constructive criticism.” Yet what is considered constructive in one culture may be viewed as destructive in another."

Building trust: "Cognitive trust is based on the confidence you feel in another person’s accomplishments, skills, and reliability." "Affective trust, on the other hand, arises from feelings of emotional closeness, empathy, or friendship." "the business value of trust."

Both important of trust to build an architectural organization and the role of architecture in the organization as a trust building (superglue).


"Style switching is an essential skill for today’s global manager."

"As a general rule of thumb, investing extra time developing a relationship-based approach will pay dividends when working with people from around the world. This is true even if you both come from task-based cultures, such as the United States and Germany. Once an affective relationship is established, the forgiveness for any cultural missteps you make comes a lot easier. So when you work internationally, no matter who you are working with, investing more time in building affective trust is a good idea.
"

Low-context for multi-cultural teams (e.g., China is high context, data about the system in low context)

## Dare To Lead

> *"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again ... who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly."*

"When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions."

"We want people to share our commitment to purpose and mission, not to comply because they’re afraid not to."

"How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?"

"The courage to be vulnerable is not about winning or losing, it’s about the courage to show up when you can’t predict or control the outcome."

"I define a leader as anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential." - our model puts trust in potential of people

"leadership is the ability to thrive in the ambiguity of paradoxes and opposites.”

Obsession with Data

In times of uncertainty and high stress, people may over reqct based on their availability bias: ad-hoc andecdotical experiences and "evidence". 
"Our organizations are littered with stories that people make up because they don’t have access to information."
"it’s a confabulation. I believe it’s true, but it’s really my fear, combined with what might be a little bit of data. And it’s dangerous."


“People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.”

“What stands in the way becomes the way.”

"Daring leaders must care for and be connected to the people they lead."

"
If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback."

"if we shield ourselves from all feedback, we stop growing. If we engage with all feedback, regardless of the quality and intention, it hurts too much,"

"We need to trust to be vulnerable, and we need to be vulnerable in order to build trust."

"Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind."

"Leaders must either invest a reasonable amount of time attending to fears and feelings, or squander an unreasonable amount of time trying to manage ineffective and unproductive behavior."

“You can never get enough of what you don’t need.”

## If we’re all so busy, why isn’t anything getting done?

[If we’re all so busy, why isn’t anything getting done?](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/if-were-all-so-busy-why-isnt-anything-getting-done#)

High-quality, focused interactions can improve productivity, speed, and innovation within any organization—and drive better business performance.

three broad categories of collaborative interactions (exhibit):

* Decision-making, including complex or uncertain decisions (for example, investment decisions) and cross-cutting routine decisions (such as quarterly business reviews)
* Creative solutions and coordination, including innovation sessions (for example, developing new products) and routine working sessions (such as daily check-ins)
* Information sharing, including one-way communication (video, for instance) and two-way communication (such as town halls with Q&As)
