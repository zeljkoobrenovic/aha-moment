When forming architecture functions, I use as a starting point these [two pieces of advice from Gregor Hohpe](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/organizing-architecture/):
 * "Your architecture team’s job is to solve your biggest problems. The best setup is the one that allows it to accomplish that."
 * "Your organization has to earn its way to an effective architecture function. You can’t just plug some architects into the current mess and expect it to solve all your problems."

<br>
Each organization will have different architectural needs and context.  


## Connecting Strategy and Implementation Building Blocks

* Be part of defining the strategy, rather then on the execution.
* Position architecture more towards innovation rather then control.
* Avoid a pure project-management role.

## Less Control, More Innovation and Strategic Impact

Another element of flexibility of the grounded architecture originates from the possibility to spend more time working on big and important problems rather than with governance. As data platform provides a solid basis to understand the state across the organization, less time is needed to do clerical tasks related to data collection. And as people are encouraged to take initiatives, more governance happens in a distributed manner. The positionin gof architecure as superglue, also enables delegating part of governance to other parts of organization.

Not against, but insists on grounding in data and people and with engineering bias and pragmatism. Against the ivory tower, but many of the conventional modeling and other tools are useful.
