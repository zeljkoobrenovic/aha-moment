Clean Code by “Uncle” Bob Martin. Good software starts with good code, and good code is clean. Here we start with the basics of naming, functions that do one thing well, and formatting.

Designing Data Intensive Systems...

Refactoring by Martin Fowler. Good software doesn’t just happen - it evolves, gains entropy, and is then restructured. The book’s subtitle reveals that this is a book about design.

Design Patterns by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides. Going ever so slightly more abstract, design patterns help us make balanced decisions on the design of our code. This title must be close to 1/2 million copies sold by now.

Building Microservices (2nd Edition) by Sam Newman is really a book about architectural trade-offs and considerations in distributed system design rather than a pitch for one specific solution. That’s why it’s a great book for architects. It’s also very accessible.

Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Neal and Mark, although also covering soft skills, dedicates the majority of the book to modularity, component-based thinking, and architectural styles. Just what an architect needs to wire things together in the right way.

Enterprise Integration Patterns is still relevant 17 years after publication (OK, minus the funny MSMQ examples and Java 1.4) for anyone trying to connect systems without coupling them too tightly. Several modern examples are available on-line.

Pattern-oriented Software Architecture—inching towards conceptual, this tome from the same “POSA” series is a tougher read, but is one of the most comprehensive references for distributed system design.


Just Enough Software Architecture by George Fairbanks is a very approachable, yet quite comprehensive title that’ll make a good addition to any architect’s bookshelf.

Software Systems Architecture by Nick and Eóin covers a similar scope to George with a slightly stronger emphasis on viewpoints and perspectives. Written by hands-on architects, it shares pearls of wisdom on most every page. The only suggestion for improvement would be to condense the content down a tiny bit—almost 700 pages require a lot of discipline and patience.

Thinking in Systems—when looking at system design and behavior from a conceptual point of view, all roads lead to system thinking and complex system theory. It’s hard to pick out a single book from this field, so I recommend Donella Meadows’ book as a gateway into this topic space.

Technology Strategy Patterns by Eben Hewitt is a nice catalog of all the stuff that appears in consultants’ fancy slide decks that you as an architect afterwards have to deal with. So, it behooves you to understand what’s going on there.

The Phoenix Project and it’s buddy The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim and his tribe are standard reading to better understand the interface between business and IT and what can all go wrong there.

Continuous Delivery—software comes into being because it is being delivered. If you are concerned with rate of change, this is something you’d want to be doing continuously. This book just celebrated its 10th anniversary and is as relevant as ever.

Accelerate—acceleration is the second derivative of position (speed being the first), so if you want to move faster you need to accelerate. Sometimes, you need to jerk the system a bit, which in fact the proper term for the third derivative.

Building Evolutionary Architectures describes how to use fitness functions to guide architectural change over time. I thought the authors could have gotten a bit more our of this topic - perhaps we’ll see a second edition.

Simon Brown’s books on Software Architecture for Developers, for example. And 
Mike Nygard’s Release It!,
