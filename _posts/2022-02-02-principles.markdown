## People, people, people: Strong Architecture = Strong Architects
> *”Architecture is not so much about the software, but about the people who write the software. The core principles of architecture, such as coupling and cohesion, aren't about the code. The code doesn't 'care' about how cohesive or decoupled it is; ... But people do care about their coupling to other team members.”* - James O. Coplien

> *"Engineers are the hidden enablers of everything that we take for granted in modern life."*
Hayaatun Sillem

we should not take our architecture talent for granted

they make most architectural decisions at Adevinta

bridging local business and technology

opportunity: unique, difficult to hire talent (tech + unique domain & organization knowledge),

future Chief Architects, CTOs, heads of engineering

challenge: not naturally connected to other architects outside their units, unclear career path

Creating a (Virtual) Talent Density

## Embrace the Scale, Beware Intuition

Maintain complete oversights at Adevinta scale and fast changes

Intuition and manual input in Excel sheets do not work at this scale

## Focus on Purpose and Interactions




## No Cheap Sits: Have Skin In The Game

> *“A lot of cheap seats in the arena are filled with people who never venture onto the floor. They just hurl mean-spirited criticisms and put-downs from a safe distance. The problem is, when we stop caring what people think and stop feeling hurt by cruelty, we lose our ability to connect. But when we’re defined by what people think, we lose the courage to be vulnerable. Therefore, we need to be selective about the feedback we let into our lives. For me, if you’re not in the arena getting your ass kicked, I’m not interested in your feedback.”* — Brené Brown, Rising Strong: The Reckoning. The Rumble. The Revolution

## Eyes On, Hands Off: Low-Context Transparency


##  Preserving Autonomy of Teams, Nudging Their Alignment

“Rather than inject itself in every decision loop, architecture should design mechanisms for teams to make better decisions - they'll know better anyhow, and slowing them down carries a high cost.”
Organizational structures
Grow and develop talent


“Autonomy does not mean you're all alone and don't align with anyone, don't get feedback from anyone and just do whatever you want.”

Ruther transparency
VAT forums (Architecture Spikes, Decisions Sharing, Tools and processes)

Perserver decision culture


### Distributed Decision Making with Publicity Principle

### Governing with Nudges Rather than Mandates and Bans

Choice-perseving appraoches


## Support Strategic Transformations


Provide focused tech strategy leadership to support strategic transformations

Aligning organizations, technology, product, and business functions
