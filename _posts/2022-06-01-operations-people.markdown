While we wanted to embrace diversity, we found it crucial to align on a shared vision on architecture across all departments. In particular, we wanted to prevent positioning of architecture as an ivory tower exercize, disconnected from realities of complex organization.

More specifically, we wanted architecture to address one of the toughest problem that our organization is facing: a tension between technology, product, organization, and business functions (Figure #). While technology, product, organization and business function face their own challenges, big problem occurs when there is a tension among them. For example, we may organize teams according to a nice domain model, but if our technology is implemented as a monolith, our teams will collaborate in a different pattern then a domain splits would suggest. On the other hand, if our teams are well aligned with the technology implementation (e.g. clear ownership of microservices) but product architecture is different that microservice domain split, we may end up changing dozens of microservices when we need to introduce relatively simple product features. Similarly, if business objectives are not well aligned with product or technology ones (e.g. reducing costs, while adding new feature, and migrating to the public cloud) lots of tense interactions will happen. In an ivory tower model, architecture sites on side, shouting principles and abstract ideals that everyone ignores.

The main problem of these tensions is that they show things down due to miscommunications and misalignment, lead to bad decisions  due to lack of information, introduce unnecessary complexity, and lead to many missed opportunities.

With this problem in mind, we wanted architecture to overall in organization focuses on reducing the tension between technology, product, organization and business functions. 

Architecture should ensure that conversations happen between the technical, product, organizational, and business functions.

As a guiding principle, we promoted a view that senior architects in our organization should develop as "superglue." We borrow this view from [Adam Bar-Niv and Amir Shenhav from Intel](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetID=454541). They pointed out that instead of the superhero, we need "super glue" architects - the fellows who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects.

The superglue characteristics mean serving as the organizational connective tissue, linking the "business wheelhouse" and the "engine room."
